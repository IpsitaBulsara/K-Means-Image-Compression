# K-Means-Image-Compression
This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to compress images by reducing the number of unique colors. The algorithm groups similar colors, creating a compressed version with fewer colors, while maintaining visual similarity and reducing file size, making it ideal for efficient image storage.
